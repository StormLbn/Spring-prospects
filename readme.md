# Prospects

Small project I did to learn **Spring Boot**, during my training with *Simplon*.
This is a small app to save clients from a form and vizualize them (CRUD).

**This version includes Spring Security to learn authentication basics, but it breaks the CRUD and CSS. See the `main` branch for working CRUD version.**

The app is unfinished and will stay so, but it contains explanatory notes (in French) that could be useful to re-do the same features or learn Spring basics, so I'll leave it here.

Feel free to use.
