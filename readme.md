# Prospects

Small project I did to learn **Spring Boot**, during my training with *Simplon*.
This is a small app to save clients from a form and vizualize them (CRUD).

The app is unfinished and will stay so, but it contains explanatory notes (in French) that could be useful to re-do the same features or learn Spring basics, so I'll leave it here.

Feel free to use.
